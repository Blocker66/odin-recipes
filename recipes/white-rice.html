  <p>Extremely simple, versatile, white rice recipe. Makes 8 1/4-cup servings.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup white rice</li>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Add rice and water to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. 
      Once boiling, lower heat to a simmer and cover. 
      Ensure it’s simmering and not boiling or the rice can cook too quickly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Simmer until water is completely absorbed and rice is tender – 
      about 15-25 minutes (will depend on size and freshness of rice). 
      Drain off any excess water if there is any (there shouldn’t be).
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>(Optional)</i> Turn off the heat, 
      remove the lid, fluff with a fork,
       put the lid back on, 
       and let rest for 10 minutes so the moisture redistributes to prevent mushy rice. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Store cooled leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 5-6 days, 
      or in the freezer up to 1 month.
      Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop with a little oil or water until warm.
    </li>
